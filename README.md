# Web-Based-Music-Player
A Web-based Music Player Application. This application is inspired by Spotify -- its deversity of music, user experience and machine learning for personal customization. So I decided to create a personal music player with ML and `getID3 libarary`(for extracting ID3 tags) to customize user experience using your songs in your File system.

After creating an account, select a folder containing all of your songs. PLAYLISTS are automatically created from your sub-folders of the main folder -- the name of the sub-folder will be the name of the playlist.

The Music player only uses HTML5 audio tag(I like its simplicity) and added with some complementary controls.
1. Shuffle
2. Repeat
