# Koffee: A music player
A Web-based Music Player Application. This application is inspired by Spotify -- its deversity of music, user experience and machine learning for personal customization. I also love the idea of seeing your interactions with your music experiences and learn your listening patterns.So I decided to create a personal music player w/o ML (I don't know it, not YET!) and `getID3 libarary`(for extracting ID3 tags) to customize user experience using your songs in your File system. Recording listeners' interactions with customized DB queries will complete your personal music experience along with graphs. 
    

## Setup   
After creating an account, select a folder containing all of your songs. PLAYLISTS are automatically created when you add a sub-folder container your songs in '/songs' folder.

## Controls
The Music player only uses HTML5 audio tag(I like its simplicity) and added with some complementary controls.
1. Shuffle
